###Introduction


Welcome to the swapi, the Star Wars API! This documentation should help you familiarise yourself with the resources available and how to consume them with HTTP requests. If you're after a native helper library then I suggest you scroll down and check out what's available. Read through the getting started section before you dive in. Most of your problems should be solved just by reading through it.

<a name="start"></a>
###Getting started


Let's make our first API request to the Star Wars API!

Open up a terminal and use [curl](http://curl.haxx.se) or [httpie](http://httpie.org) to make an API request for a resource. In the example below, we're trying to get the first planet, Tatooine:

    http swapi.dev/api/planets/1/

We'll use [httpie](http://httpie.org) for our examples as it displays responses nicely and gives us a whole lot more useful information. If you don't want to download httpie, just use the *curl* command instead.

Here is the response we get:

    HTTP/1.0 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json
    {
        "climate": "Arid",
        "diameter": "10465",
        "gravity": "1 standard",
        "name": "Tatooine",
        "orbital_period": "304",
        "population": "200000",
        "residents": [
            "https://swapi.dev/api/people/1/",
            "https://swapi.dev/api/people/2/",
            ...
        ],
        "rotation_period": "23",
        "surface_water": "1",
        "terrain": "Dessert",
        "url": "https://swapi.dev/api/planets/1/"
    }

If your response looks slightly different don't panic. This is probably because more data has been added to swapi since we made this documentation.

<a name="base"></a>
###Base URL

The **Base URL** is the root URL for all of the API, if you ever make a request to swapi and you get back a **404 NOT FOUND** response then check the Base URL first.

The Base URL for swapi is:

    https://swapi.dev/api/

The documentation below assumes you are prepending the Base URL to the endpoints in order to make requests.

<a name="rate"></a>
###Rate limiting

Swapi has rate limiting to prevent malicious abuse (as if anyone would abuse Star Wars data!) and to make sure our service can handle a potentially large amount of traffic. Rate limiting is done via IP address and is currently limited to 10,000 API request per day. This is enough to request all the data on the website at least ten times over. There should be no reason for hitting the rate limit.

<a name="auth"></a>
###Authentication

Swapi is a **completely open API**. No authentication is required to query and get data. This also means that we've limited what you can do to just **GET**-ing the data. If you find a mistake in the data, then [tweet the author](https://twitter.com/phalt_) or [email him](mailto:paulandrewhallett@gmail.com).

<a name="schema"></a>
###JSON Schema

All resources support [JSON Schema](https://jsonschema.net). Making a request to ```/api/<resource>/schema``` will give you the details of that resource. This will allow you to programmatically inspect the attributes of that resource and their types.

<a name="search"></a>
###Searching

All resources support a `search` parameter that filters the set of resources returned.  This allows you to make queries like:

```
https://swapi.dev/api/people/?search=r2
```

 All searches will use case-insensitive partial matches on the set of search fields. To see the set of search fields for each resource, check out the individual resource documentation. For more information on advanced search terms see [here](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/filtering/#searchfilter).

#Encodings
- - -

SWAPI provides two encodings for you to render the data with:

<a name="json"></a>
###JSON

JSON is the standard data format provided by SWAPI by default.

<a name="wookiee"></a>
###Wookiee

Wookiee is for our tall hairy allies who speak Wookiee, this encoding is identical to JSON except with wookiee translations.

Using the wookiee renderer is easy, just append `?format=wookiee` to your urls:

```
https://swapi.dev/api/planets/1/?format=wookiee
```

#Resources
